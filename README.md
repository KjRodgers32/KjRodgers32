### A Little About Me:

Hi all! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kevin and I currently work as a Data Analyst. I enjoy programming and am looking to transition into Data Engineering. I specialize in automating tasks and developing applications in Python.
I also like to pull data that I find interesting into a database and display it in either some web app or just a data visualization using a BI tool.
